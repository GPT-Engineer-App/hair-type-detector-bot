# hair-type-detector-bot

This project involves creating a Python code for a Telegram bot. The bot will accept a photo of a human head from the user and use an API to query the OpenAI model, asking, "What type of hair is depicted in the photo?". It then sends the response back to the Telegram user who submitted the photo. The bot is designed not to store photos on its server side after processing.
